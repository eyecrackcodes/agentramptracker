# Agent Metrics Tracking System - Manager's Guide

## Overview
The Agent Metrics Tracking System helps you monitor and track agent performance using a tenure-based approach. This guide explains how to use the system effectively and ensure consistent data entry across your team.

## Understanding Tenure-Based Months

### How It Works
- Instead of using calendar months, we track metrics based on each agent's tenure
- Month 1 starts from the agent's first day on phones
- Each subsequent month rolls over on the same day of the month
- The system automatically calculates the current tenure month

Example:
```
If an agent starts on January 15, 2024:
- Month 1: January 15 - February 14
- Month 2: February 15 - March 14
- Month 3: March 15 - April 14
And so on...
```

## Data Entry Guide

### For New Agents
1. Navigate to the agent's profile
2. Click "Add Metrics"
